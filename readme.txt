Extend MemberMouse with much needed features and integrations. Including Google Enhanced Ecommerce tracking, Custom logout pages, SSL support, and much more!

== Description ==
*PowerPack for MemberMouse LITE* is a fantastic upgrade to MemberMouse, allowing you to truly see how your membership site is operating by sending revenue data to Google Enhanced Ecommerce for reporting. This plugin also contains other fantastic features worth noting:

- Google Enhanced Ecommerce tracking - Track Initial Payments, Rebills, and Refunds in Google Analytics.
- Custom log out pages - by default MemberMouse sends your users to a \"logout\" page when logging them out. This is typically not how most sites handle log outs. With this plugin, you\'ll be able to send your users to your home page on log out or send them to a custom page of your choosing *based on their Membership Level*!
- EasySSL Support - Never worry about a secure site. Our SSL add on will allow you to force all traffic to the https version of your website and will fix all mixed content warnings (which happens when a secure site requests a non-secure asset - like an image). This is NOT a replacement for a valid SSL Certificate!
